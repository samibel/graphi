     CI-enforced:     internal/coverage drift guard fails the build if this
                      matrix omits, adds, or mislabels a live capability
                      (registered parsers/analyzers, advertised MCP tools, present surfaces). -->

Every row below is checked against the live registries by the `coverage-matrix`
CI gate (`internal/coverage`). A docs-only change that contradicts the code — a
missing capability, a phantom "shipped" entry, or a live capability marked
"planned" — breaks the build. **Legend:** ✅ shipped · 🟡 partial · ⏳ planned.

Total capabilities: **133**. See [`architecture-plan.md`](architecture-plan.md) for the design context.

| `communities` | ✅ shipped | EP-017 | SW-104: SW-103 Louvain community detection surfaced behind the single dispatch table. |
| `compare-branches` | ✅ shipped | EP-018 | SW-107: graph-level branch diff over TWO already-built read-only graph states (materialized above the surface boundary) — added/removed/changed/moved entities + edges added/removed, keyed by canonical NodeId (not line ranges); detects signature/contract changes and correlates cross-file moves by path-independent symbol identity; pure local set-diff, zero engine egress (the engine never resolves a git ref). |
| `concept` | ✅ shipped | EP-004 | lexical-search-backed concept resolution (needs Searcher). |
| `conflicts-prs` | ✅ shipped | EP-018 | SW-106: inter-PR conflict detection over an enumerated PR set — textual overlap + shared file/symbol/high-centrality node + asymmetric contract-dependency edge check; entity→PRs inverted index, byte-stable pairwise report (zero engine egress; forge enumeration stays at the surface). |
| `contracts` | ✅ shipped | EP-005 | producer/consumer contract drift detection. |
| `critique-review` | ✅ shipped | EP-018 | SW-108 (capstone): deterministic graph-evidence critique of an EXISTING PR review — replays the EP-007 risk/blast/centrality/taint oracle over the touched set and runs a three-way diff (gap / over_flag / unsupported_claim) against the review; deterministic resolveRef anchoring with an honest unanchored tally (never guessed); NO LLM prose; total order type→NodeId→anchor; zero engine egress (the only egress is the surface review fetch). |

| `pr-signals` | ✅ shipped | EP-007 | hub/bridge/surprise signals on PR-changed code. |
| `suggest-reviewers` | ✅ shipped | EP-018 | SW-107: ranked candidate-reviewer recommender — file-granular ownership + recency-decayed churn over the touched files (fixed decay reference, never now()) plus symbol-granular affected-subgraph proximity (callers/callees/contract neighbors, centrality-weighted), folded into a fixed-integer composite with a transparent per-signal breakdown; deterministic total order (composite DESC, reviewer identity ASC); zero engine egress. |
| `taint` | ✅ shipped | EP-005 | flow-sensitive source→sink taint analysis. |

## Feature-Unit (5)

| id | status | epic | note |
|---|---|---|---|
| `FU-1` | ✅ shipped | EP-001 | Cross-file / cross-package linker pass (SW-050, engine/link) — resolves selector calls/imports against the committed symbol table; wired into ingest with a Go resolver. |
| `FU-2` | ✅ shipped | EP-001 | Curated pure-Go language tier (20 gotreesitter grammars + 2 stdlib) + opt-in graphi-broad CGO flavor. |

| `FU-5` | ✅ shipped | EP-001 | Per-language cross-file/cross-package resolvers over engine/link (SW-063), with ingest dispatching the linker per language. Resolvers: Go, TypeScript family (ts/tsx/js), Python, Rust, Java, Kotlin, C#, C, C++, Ruby, PHP, Lua, Bash. SQL is an honest no-op (no provable cross-file refs at this tier → skip+count). Each is heuristic tier, deterministic, byte-identical full-vs-incremental, never confirmed, never fabricates. |
